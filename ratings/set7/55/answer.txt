// HB: rating: 0

In the provided solution, we used the prompt rule provided in the exercise.

In our second solution, we modified lex() in parser/Parser.ih:
inline int Parser::lex()
{
    std::cout << "? ";
    return d_scanner.lex();
}
This doesn't produce the right output:
? 12354
? ? 42353
? ? 4325
? ?
// HB: you're on the right track, but you need modify the Parser::lex() a little bit to make it work
// HB: our implementation is 4 LoC

In our third solution, we modified lex() in scanner/lex.cc:
int Scanner::lex()
{
    std::cout << "? ";
    return lex_() != 0        ? d_token_ :
           interactiveLine() ?   lex_()   :
                                 0;
    // HB: TC
}
This yields correct results:
? 14325
? 4325
? 4325
?
// HB: for the third solution you indeed have to modify the scanner, just not the lex() function
