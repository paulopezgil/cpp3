In the case that the unordered_map may be altered during the lifetime of our class's object, sort() will not return the map updated with the new data, as d_map was constructed when UnorderedSort was constructed.
One possible solution would be to reconstruct d_map with d_umap each time that sort function is called, for example defining a helper function updateMap(), which of course would be less efficient.
