Suppose that we've overloaded the plus operator using an expression template:

template <typename Lhs, typename Rhs>
BinExpr<Lhs, Rhs, std::plus>
operator+(Lhs const &lhs, Rhs const &rhs)
{
	return BinExpr<Lhs, Rhs, plus>{ lhs, rhs };
}

>> What's the result of the above expression?

When evaluating the expression v1 + v2 + v3 + v4 operator + is called returning a BinExpr<BinExpr<BinExpr<VI, VI, std::plus>>, VI, std::plus>, VI, std::plus>, which is a very efficient way to compute the sum of 4 VI objects.
The beauty of the overloaded index operator is that it works with both left operands being a BinExpr or the original container, as seen in the implementation provided in the slides. This is the key part of the implementation: it allows us to evaluate the expression element by element, avoiding unnecessary copies and thus improving the efficiency.
So, when the conversion operator is called for BinExpr, it computes the sum of each element of the array recursively using the index operator in a very efficient way.
